## [Project 1 : Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/VishnuHSharma/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree)
- #### Technologies: SQL, Tableau, MS Excel
- Query data from SQL database and subsequently export it as CSV file.
- Clean the data and calculate moving averages since it is time series data.
- Plot the moving averages comparing global temperatures and local temperatures of a given city.

##### These charts depict the moving average temperature in Celsius, which clearly shows that temperature is steadily rising.

## [Project 2 - Investigating and Reporting Findings from a dataset](https://github.com/VishnuHSharma/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree)
- #### Technologies and libraries: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn
- Gather and assess a dataset and identify rudimentary errors that need to be remedied.
- Clean the data and get it ready for the exploratory data analysis phase.
- Utilize charts appropriately in order to convey information that is required.

## [Project 3 - Visualizing Earnings based on Major](https://github.com/VishnuHSharma/Visualizing-earnings-based-on-major)
- #### Technologies and libraries: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn
- This project utilizes  data set that was released by the American Community Survey and cleaned by Fivethirtyeight and released on their github repo. 
- It contains information about college students and majors and their reported earnings. This project is a part of the dataquest data scientist path, but I extended it to do my    own analysis.
